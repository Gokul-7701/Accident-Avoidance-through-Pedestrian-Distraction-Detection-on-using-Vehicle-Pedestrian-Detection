# Accident-Avoidance-through-Pedestrian-Distraction-Detection-on-using-Vehicle-Pedestrian-Detection
Distraction can be a serious problem in our daily lives. Distraction has caused multiple accidents in the recent years. This project is built to detect vehicle(and its trajectory) and pedestrians (their trajectory & whether they are distracted).
The vehicle is detected and its trajectory is found. The pedestrain is detected and its trajectory is found. If the trajectories meet, we predict their will be an accident. We also predict if the pedestrian is distracted or not.
